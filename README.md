# How to run the game:
Clone the repository and create a new virtual environment using the "requirements.txt" file found in the project root directory "ZombieGame".

To populate the datatbase with example users and data, run the python file "populate_game" found in the "zombie_proj" directory.
This popualtion script adds a number of "users" to the database, allowing sample data to be displayed on the leaderboards.

Three users are available to log in as, these users are "bob", "jill" and "jen" and their passwords are their usernames.
